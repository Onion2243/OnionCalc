# How To Use Terminal Mode

When Running The Calculator For The First Time You Should Get An Interface Similar To This

```
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  ALGEBRAIC CALCULATOR V.0.1.0
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  1: Artithmatic Functions
  2: Algebraic Functions
  3: Geomentry
  4: Triginomentry
  5: Conversion
  6: Quits Program
  
      
  0: Show Your Past Calculations
  
  Enter The Type Of Mode:
```

You Shouldn't need to use your Keyboard for this, Just Your Number Pad. For Example if you typed in 1 And pressed enter You Would Get This Pop Up

```
  1: Addition
  2: Subtraction
  3: Multiplication
  4: Division
  5: Exponents
  
  Enter The Type Of Mode: 

```

Basically Entering 1 Brings You Into Arthimatic (Basic Math) Mode. From There you can continue using your number pad to select what type of basic math you want to do, eventually it will get to a point where you enter in the numbers

```
  Enter The Type Of Mode: 1


  Enter the First Number: 12
  Enter the Second Number: 12
  
  Solution: 24 
```

(Obviously, you need to understand the math behind what you're doing to actually make use of OnionCalc.)
